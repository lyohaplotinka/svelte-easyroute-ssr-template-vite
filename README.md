# Svelte + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte + [Svelte Easyroute](https://github.com/lyohaplotinka/svelte-easyroute) in Vite with SSR.

## Get started

Install the dependencies

```bash
cd svelte-easyroute-ssr-template
npm install
```

If you want to try SSR right now, execute `npm run build` first, and
then `npm run start:ssr`.

### package.json scripts
* `build` - build both server-side and client-side app
* `dev` - run client-side app in development mode (hot-reload, etc.)
* `start` - run vite for build client-side app (without SSR)
* `start:ssr` - run Express.js server with SSR

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.
